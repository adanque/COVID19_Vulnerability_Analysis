The purpose of my analysis is to analyze if we the US can bend the curve (“BendCurve”, ”No BendCurve”) per the Covid 19 pandemic. While evaluating the factors from CDC data for number of days since first case (up to April 10, 2020), number of confirmed cases, number of deaths, number of recovered by States. In addition to this data other factors added are if the State votes more for Republican / Democrat, if the Governor is Republican or Democrat as well as if the Senior US Senator is a Democrat or Republican.
